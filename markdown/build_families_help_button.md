As GAMs are a generalised model, they can use different distribution families when modelling the conditional distribution of the response variable. The 'family' dropdown provides a way to select this family when building your GAM. Selecting the family to use can be difficult and ensuring you have selected the correct family is an important part of evaluating your model. To choose an intial famaily consider 'Once I have taken into account all my covariates, what do I think the distribution of my predictions will be?'.
