# Wrap Up

This GAM tutorial was designed to introduce you to core GAM concepts to provide enough understanding to use this application. My hope is that when you move to the next section on using the Build tab of this application that you have an understanding on what each option presented to you does and where to find more theoretical information to expand your knowledge.

This tutorial is adapted from Simon Wood's _Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R_ 2nd ed (2017) and I have made an effort to provide page numbers for each tutorial section so that you can read from the source directly to learn more. This isn't to say that you cannot learn about GAMs from other sources but simply acknowledging the source of this material and an encouragement to read further.

In the next section, the shift moves away from theory found in the textbook and towards the practical implementation of GAMs with the mgcv package used by this application.
