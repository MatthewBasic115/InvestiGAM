This graph plots the basis functions for a given smooth using the _gratia_ draw() function (Simpson, 2024). It is the same as what you can find under the 'Basis Plots' item in the Interpret module. This can give you a good idea of how your smooths are constructed using the basis functions. For example, looking at s(ndvi\_ma12), you can see that the smooth was unable to model any complexity which likely contributed to it being statistically insignificant.

TODO: Explain the factor stuff. Is it possible to get a better plot?
