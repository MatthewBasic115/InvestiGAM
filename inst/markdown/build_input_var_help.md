The selection to the right allows you to input your variables for the smooth. Smooths can be multivariate, so you are not limited to a single option.

If you wish to create a smooth for each factor level of a categorical variable, select the variable of interest here (e.g. time) and then enter the categorical variable in by input below.

This input does not allow any transformations, so please try and do so before you load in your dataset.
