This is a general help pop-up for the Formula Terms page. For more detailed information please see the 'Build' menu under the Learn tab.

Once you have selected your hyperparameters, it is time to start building out the model terms.

First you will need to select your response variable. This will not appear in the formula preview.

Next, you now have options on what terms to add to your model. Parametric terms are as you would expect from a standard model. Smooth terms are more complicated and you can find details in the Learn section or under specific help menu items.

Once you have created a term, you can use the Operators to include interactions. Make sure to add the '+' in between terms to ensure your formula is created successfully!

If you do not want to build your formula through the GUI, then use the raw text input. The help menu there provides more details.

When an error occurs for building the model a pop-up will appear detailing the message. These are passed from mgcv (or wherever in the stack the error occurred) so look for the errors in its documentation.
