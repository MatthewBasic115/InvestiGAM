Before building our model, let's take a closer look at the data.

The first graph below is a histogram of capture counts. i.e. How many times each count of captures occurred. In this histogram we can see high counts for both 1 and 0 before a significant drop to 20 or below for higher counts. This doesn't seem too surprising considering we are counting animal captures and provides an idea of how the response is distributed.
