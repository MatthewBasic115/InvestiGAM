# GAM Methods

The method input determines how the regularisation smoothing penalties $\lambda$ will be estimated. The recommended default is to use Restricted Maximum Likelihood ('REML') which will work for all families. See the 'Regularisation of Wiggliness' section in the GAM page under the Learn tab to get a more detailed explanation.
