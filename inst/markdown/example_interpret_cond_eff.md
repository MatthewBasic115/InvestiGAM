The below plot is what you would see if you selected 'Partial Effect of Smooths' item in the navigation menu for the Interpret module. It plots each smooth function for the given model and allows you to quickly visualise the output of each smooth function. 

This function is a good way to interpret individual smooths but, it does have some weaknesses. First, everything is plotted on the link scale which does not always linearly translate to the response scale and can be harder to interpret. Secondly, if a variable occurs in more then one smooth, then you cannot easily tell how that variable impacts the prediction across the entire model. Fortunately, we have tools to overcome both of these weaknesses!
