# Student Example Introduction

This section provides a worked example to help you understand how to use this application and interpret GAMs.

As the GAM theory and instructions for building GAMs has already been explained earlier, this walkthrough will assume you already have this knowledge. It will mostly focus on helping you interpret the result of a GAM and how you can evaluate your model.

For this walkthrough, we will be building a GAM which predicts the number of captures for different rodent species from the Portal Project dataset.
