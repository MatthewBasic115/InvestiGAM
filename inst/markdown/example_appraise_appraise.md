*Appraise*

The appraisal section provides plots to check if our GAM is valid. Observing the QQ plot we can see a problem with our model. In the lower bounds we can see points well below the theoretical line and outside our confidence interval. This indicates that something is wrong with our model. On the next page, we'll increase _k_ on some of our terms to see if that improves our model.
