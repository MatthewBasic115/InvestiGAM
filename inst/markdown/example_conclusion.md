# Walkthrough Complete!

Thank you for completing the Student Walkthrough! Hopefully, this walkthrough has gotten you more comfortable with the Interpret and Appraise tabs in InvestiGAM and how to use them effectively. This walkthrough mostly displayed the basic functionality of the Interpret tab, so please visit the tab and try out the advanced options which let you manually specify your conditional inputs using _marginaleffects_ inputs.

In this walkthrough we covered:

The outputs of the Appraise module. Reading the Summary output in the context of _mgcv_, using gam.check() to determine an appropriate value for _k_ and using the appraisal plots to look for issues in the model. We saw an example of an underfit, well fit and overfit model to use as a reference moving forward.

I also gave an introduction to the Interpret tab including the basis functions, partial effect of smooth plots and the 
_marginaleffects_ plots of predictions, slopes and comparisons. 

If you would like to play around with the Portal Project dataset and model more, there is a quickload button in the Load module which will load the dataset and model into InvestiGAM.
