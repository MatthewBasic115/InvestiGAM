# Gam Families

This menu allows you to select the distribution family for the response variable in your GAM. It uses the `mgcv.families` class to provide options, with some removed in order to reduce complexity. See `?family.mgcv` in the `mgcv` documentation for more information.

Common distributions include Normal, Binomial, Gamma and Poisson. Different distributions are better suited to different methods or link functions, check the help text on these items or the `mgcv` documentation for more information.
