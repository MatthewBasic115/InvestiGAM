# Student Tutorial

This tab allows you to start the Student Tutorial (ST). The ST is designed to introduce students to GAMs and how to build and interpret them in this application. The Student Tutorial is adapted from Simon Wood's _Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R Second Edition_ (Wood, 2017) with a focus on explaining concepts rather then technical detail.
The concepts taught allow the user to interact with the application and learn how to build and interpret simple GAMs in a practical context.
It is expected that students who wish to understand the underlying theory will learn this in their classroom, from the textbook or other sources themselves.
Although the tutorial is designed to introduce students to GAMs, it is also a useful tool for any person who wishes to learn how to use this application.

You can select which lessons to view from the tabs above.

### Pre-requisites

Although designed for students, this application uses GAMs which are complex models. As such, it is expected that students have knowledge in statistics and basic Machine Learning models before starting the tutorial. It is expected that students have knowledge in the following areas:

1) The exponential family of probability distributions.

2) Linear Models and the theory behind them.

3) Model selection and interpretation.

4) Understanding of loss functions and Gradient Descent.
