# Plot Slopes

Similar to the predictions plots, the slopes section allows you to plot both conditional and marginal slopes. For the slopes plots, you provide a variable of interest and then either conditional or marginal variables. The partial derivative with respect to the variable of interest is calculated and then plotted.

Unique to the slopes plots is the 'slope' input, which determines the type of slope you wish to compute. If you are unfamiliar with this option, then leave it at the default dydx.
