One important consideration for this dataset is the variance between captures for different species. Below plots the captures for four species over time. As you can see Merriam's kangaroo rat (DM) species is captured far more then other species. Additionally, Ord's kangaroo rat (DO) and Bailey's pocket mouse (PB) both start with relatively low counts before larger increases in the back half of the time period. You can also see some gaps in the data which are due to missed readings. This could be due to weather or COVID restrictions (Ernest, 2018).
