Welcome!

This project aims to make interpreting Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) easier through the use of the Shiny framework. Shiny provides a front end which allows users who are not well-versed in build and interpreting GAMs to learn how to do so without having to code. The framework uses the mgcv package to create it's GAMs and marginaleffects to build it's plots. 

My current goal is to have this package accepted into CRAN.


To run the app, run app.R at the top level directory.
