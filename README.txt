Welcome!

This project aims to make interpreting Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) easier through the use of the Shiny framework. Shiny provides a front end which allows users who are not well-versed in build and interpreting GAMs to learn how to do so without having to code. The framework uses the mgcv package to create it's GAMs. This project is still in its early stages with an eventual goal to provide students with a way to learn how to build and interpret GAMs easily.

As the project nears completion, further testing and documentation will be made available.

To run the app, run app.R at the top level directory.
